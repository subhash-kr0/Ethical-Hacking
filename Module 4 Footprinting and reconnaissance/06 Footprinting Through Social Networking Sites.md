   - **Purpose:** Professional profiles, job titles, organizational structure.
   - **Key Information:** Employee details, company hierarchy, job postings.

2. **Facebook**
   - **Purpose:** Personal details, relationships, location.
   - **Key Information:** Family members, friends, places visited.

3. **Twitter**
   - **Purpose:** Public statements, interests, real-time activities.
   - **Key Information:** Tweets, follower lists, hashtags used.

4. **Instagram**
   - **Purpose:** Visual content, personal interests, locations.
   - **Key Information:** Photos, geotags, hashtags.

5. **Reddit**
   - **Purpose:** Discussions, user interests, community involvement.

## Techniques for Social Networking Footprinting

1. **Profile Enumeration**
   - Search for specific individuals or organizations to gather profiles and related information.
   - Example: Search for employees of a specific company on LinkedIn.

2. **Network Analysis**
   - Analyze connections between individuals to map out organizational structures or personal networks.
