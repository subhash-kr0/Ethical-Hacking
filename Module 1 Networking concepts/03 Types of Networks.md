# Types of Networks

## 1. Personal Area Network (PAN)
- **Scale**: Very small, typically within a range of a few meters.
- **Use**: Connecting devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops within a person's workspace.
- **Example**: Bluetooth, USB connections.

## 2. Local Area Network (LAN)
- **Scale**: Confined to a small geographical area, such as a building or campus.
- **Use**: Connecting computers, printers, and other devices within a single organization or home.
- **Example**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.

## 3. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
- **Scale**: Similar to LAN but uses wireless technology.
- **Use**: Provides mobility to devices within the local area.
- **Example**: Wi-Fi networks in homes, offices, and public places.

## 4. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- **Scale**: Spans a city or a large campus.
- **Use**: Connects multiple LANs within a metropolitan area, providing high-speed connectivity.
- **Example**: City-wide Wi-Fi, interconnecting university campuses.

## 5. Wide Area Network (WAN)
- **Scale**: Covers a large geographical area, such as a country or continent.
- **Use**: Connects multiple LANs and MANs across long distances.
- **Example**: The Internet, corporate networks spanning multiple locations.

## 6. Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- **Scale**: Can be as large as a WAN but is a secure, private network overlaid on a public network like the Internet.
- **Use**: Provides secure access to a network from remote locations.
- **Example**: Remote access VPNs used by companies.

## 7. Storage Area Network (SAN)
- **Scale**: Typically confined to data centers.
- **Use**: Provides a high-speed network specifically for data storage devices.
- **Example**: Fibre Channel SAN, iSCSI SAN.

## 8. Enterprise Private Network (EPN)
- **Scale**: Large-scale, typically for large organizations.
- **Use**: Interconnects different offices or branches within an organization securely.
- **Example**: A global companyâ€™s private network connecting all its offices.

## 9. Campus Area Network (CAN)
- **Scale**: Larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN, often covering a campus.
- **Use**: Connects multiple LANs within a limited geographical area like a university campus.
- **Example**: University networks.

## 10. Home Area Network (HAN)
- **Scale**: Limited to a home environment.
- **Use**: Connects devices like computers, printers, and smart home devices within a household.
- **Example**: A home Wi-Fi network connecting phones, tablets, and smart TVs.

## 11. Internet of Things (IoT) Network
- **Scale**: Varies, from home automation to city-wide smart grids.
- **Use**: Connects a vast number of devices, sensors, and machines to the Internet, enabling data exchange and remote control.
- **Example**: Smart home devices, industrial IoT systems.

## 12. Global Area Network (GAN)
- **Scale**: Covers worldwide networks.
- **Use**: Provides connectivity to devices around the globe, often using satellites.
- **Example**: Satellite communication networks, global mobile networks.
