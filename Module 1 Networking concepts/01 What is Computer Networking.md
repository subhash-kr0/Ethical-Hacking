# What is Computer Networking?

**Computer Networking** is the practice of connecting multiple computers and other devices together to share resources and communicate. It involves a combination of hardware, software, and protocols to enable data exchange between devices across various distances, from local areas (LAN) to global scales (WAN).

## Key Concepts in Computer Networking

### Network Types
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network covering a small geographic area, like a home or office. Examples include Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A network that covers a broad geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs. The Internet is the largest WAN.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: Covers a city or large campus.
- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Connects devices within a very close range, such as Bluetooth connections.

### Network Topologies
- **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central hub or switch.
- **Bus Topology**: All devices are connected to a single central cable.
- **Ring Topology**: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
- **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected, providing multiple paths for data.

### Network Protocols
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: Ensures reliable data transmission by establishing connections and managing data packets.
- **Internet Protocol (IP)**: Responsible for addressing and routing packets across networks.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: Used for transferring web pages over the Internet.
- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: Facilitates file transfer between systems.

### Network Devices
- **Router**: Connects different networks and directs data packets between them.
- **Switch**: Connects devices within the same network, managing data flow to ensure efficient communication.
- **Hub**: A basic device that connects multiple devices in a network but does not manage data flow effectively.
- **Modem**: Converts digital data into signals suitable for transmission over telephone lines or other communication media.

### Network Security
- **Firewalls**: Protect networks from unauthorized access and threats.
- **Encryption**: Secures data by converting it into a code to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

### Network Models
- **OSI Model**: A conceptual framework with seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application) that standardize network functions.
- **TCP/IP Model**: A more practical model with four layers (Link, Internet, Transport, Application) that forms the basis of the Internet.
